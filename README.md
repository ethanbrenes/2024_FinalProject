Target User Profile
Name & Position: Jameson Carlton, College Football Recruiting/Scouting Analyst
Background Description: Jameson is newly working for a college football scouting department. He has been tasked with handling the scouting of high school players in the class of 2025 and beyond. To get a sense of what to look for, Jameson turns to college football’s largest recruiting website: 247Sports. Jameson is hoping to utilize their rankings to find new players for the coaches on his team to watch. Even though he is new, Jameson knows there are a few key bits of information he must have to effectively locate and evaluate new potential prospects. These are height, weight, rank, state, school, and year. He will need to filter, sequence, and retrieve this data on any given player. 

User Case Scenarios
Scenario 1:
	Upon arriving at the interactive, the target user is prompted to select the year in which the players they are looking for will be graduating. The user selects 2025. Then, the user is greeted by a map of the United States displaying all ranked players, according to 247Sports, in the class of 2025. The user will then be allowed to search the map as is, utilizing pan and zoom, or they can filter the players based on their own specific criteria. There are options to filter by height, weight, position, state, and rank. There will also be a list of players, that is generated based on graduation year chosen, with the ability to sort based on any of those same criteria (except state). As a test, the target user chooses to look for only offensive lineman in the state of Michigan. The target user is left with eight players remaining on the map. Regardless of state chosen, the target user will have access to a bar chart displaying the number of ranked prospects from each state, as well as the option to make the map a choropleth map based on average recruit ranking.
Scenario 2:
Upon arriving at the interactive, the target user is prompted to select the year in which the players they are looking for will be graduating. The user selects 2026. Then, the user is greeted by a map of the United States displaying all ranked players, according to 247Sports, in the class of 2026. The user will then be allowed to search the map as is, utilizing pan and zoom, or they can filter the players based on their own specific criteria. There are options to filter by height, weight, position, state, and rank. As a test, the target user chooses to look for only players listed as “athlete” in the state of Michigan. The target user is left with one player remaining on the map.
